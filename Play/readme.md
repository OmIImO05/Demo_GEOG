# Introduction
This is Shabiha. It is just a sub-folder of Demo_GEOG to practice how to generate a markdown file and play with it a little bit. This sub-folder consists of how to write headings, highlights, Italics, strike through, ordered and unordered list items, inline codes, codeblocks, add images, hyperlinks and YouTube videos. Let's get started!

## Headings
In the Introduction and Headings section I already used different size of fonts just using **#** before the sentence. Increasing the number of **#** will decrease the size of the font, kind of a perpendicular relationship.

## Highlight/Italics/Strike through
I want to learn everything **properly** from the course as wel as want to build a useful *python package* ~~in future~~ soon. In this line, I used two ** to highlight the text properly and one * to do the italics and ~~ to strike through.

## Ordered and Unordered List
In this course I learned so far -

### Ordered list

3. How to open a website
4. How to fork and pull any repo
5. How to work on a markdown file
6. How to jupyter notebook to the github
7. How to build a package

## Adding Image/Logo
So I talked a lot about this course which is named *Geographic Software Design* this course is under the department of **Geography and Sustainability** of the University of Tennessee Knoxville and taught gracefully by [Dr. Quisheng Wu](https://wetlands.io/).

## Adding Hyperlink & Footnotes
[Dr. Quisheng Wu](https://faculty.utk.edu/Qiusheng.Wu) is an Associate Professor in the Department of Geography & Sustainability at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. In addition, he holds positions as an Amazon Visiting Academic and a Senior Research Fellow at the United Nations University. Specializing in geospatial data science and open-source software development. Check out his website [^1] to know about his work!

## Inline Codes & Codeblocks
### Inline Codes:

<dl>
  <dt>Learned Things in the GEOG 510 Course:</dt>
  <dd>1. Installing packages and software
  2. Building a Github profile and Personal Website
  3. Build a package </dd>

  ### Codeblocks:
You can install packages developed by Dr. Wu [^1]. Here are the codes to install the packages and work on it.

```Python
conda install -c conda-forge leafmap
import leafmap
m = leafmap.m()
```

## Adding YouTube Videos
You can subscribe and follow the Open Geospatial Solution for the detail demonstration which is maintained and updated regularly by Dr. Wu [^1].
