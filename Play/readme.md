# Introduction
This is Shabiha. It is just a sub-folder of Demo_GEOG to practice how to generate a markdown file and play with it a little bit. This sub-folder consists of how to write headings, highlights, Italics, strikethrough, ordered and unordered list items, inline codes, codeblocks, add images, hyperlinks and YouTube videoes. Let's get started!

## Headings
In the Introduction and Headings section I already used different size of fonts just using **#** before the sentence. Increasing the number of **#** will decrease the size of the font, kind of a perpendicular relationship.

## Highlight/Italics/Strikethrough
I want to learn everything **properly** from the course as wel as want to build a useful *python package* ~~in future~~ soon. In this line, I used two ** to hughlight the text properly and one * to do the italics and ~~ to strikethrough.
